**Subject: Initiation of OS & Database Patching Cycle – Business Review & Approval Required**

Dear [Business Owner Name],

This letter outlines the planned patching cycle for our SQL Server databases (versions 2012-2022) and requires your review and approval.  Regular patching is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of our systems.

**Patching Plan:**

We propose a structured patching schedule that will address critical security vulnerabilities and performance improvements.  The detailed plan, including specific patch versions and timelines, is attached for your review. [Attach the detailed patching plan here]

**Testing and Approval:**

* **Lower Environments (e.g., Dev, Test):** Patching in these environments will be performed proactively with notification emails sent to relevant stakeholders.
* **Production Environment:**  All patching in the production environment will be conducted via an approved RFC (Request for Change) process to ensure minimal disruption to business operations.  This requires your formal approval for each database before proceeding.  Please indicate your approval or rejection for each database listed in the attached plan.

**Business Testing:**

Please provide the names of your designated business testers who will validate the patches in the test environment before deployment to production.  Their confirmation is a prerequisite for marking each patch as complete.


**Action Required:**

Please review the attached patching plan and confirm your approval or rejection for each database by [Date - allow reasonable time for review].  If you have any concerns or require further clarification, please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Department]

**Subject: Initiation of OS & Database Patching Cycle – Joint Business/DBA Plan**

Dear [Business Owner Name],

This letter outlines a collaborative plan for the upcoming OS and database patching cycle, developed with consideration for both business operations and database administration best practices.  Regular patching is critical for maintaining the security, stability, and performance of our systems.

**Patching Scope and Methodology:**

This cycle will address critical security vulnerabilities and performance improvements across all operating systems and database platforms supporting business applications.  The specific patches to be applied will be determined based on vulnerability assessments, vendor recommendations, and the current patch levels of our systems.

**Phased Approach:**

To minimize disruption to business operations, we propose a phased approach:

1. **Assessment and Planning:** A detailed assessment will be conducted to identify all required patches, schedule downtime (where necessary), and define testing procedures.  This includes a thorough review of the impact of patching on business-critical applications.

2. **Testing and Validation:**  All patches will be rigorously tested in non-production environments (e.g., development, testing) before deployment to production. This will involve collaboration between the DBA team and business representatives to ensure functionality and performance are not negatively impacted.  We will schedule a joint testing session to review the results and address any concerns.

3. **Production Deployment:**  Production deployments will be scheduled during off-peak hours or planned maintenance windows to minimize disruption.  The deployment process will be closely monitored by the DBA team, and business representatives will be notified of the progress.  A post-deployment review will be conducted to assess the overall impact of the patching.

**Communication and Collaboration:**

Throughout the patching cycle, we will maintain open communication channels to keep you informed of progress, potential challenges, and any necessary adjustments to the plan.  We will hold regular meetings to discuss the status and address any concerns.

**Business Impact Mitigation:**

We understand the importance of minimizing any potential business impact.  Our plan incorporates risk mitigation strategies, including thorough testing, rollback procedures, and contingency plans.

**Action Required:**

We request your formal approval to proceed with the patching cycle as outlined above.  Please schedule a brief meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss this plan in detail and answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Department]
