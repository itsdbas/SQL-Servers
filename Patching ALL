SQL Server Database Patching Checklist
Pre-Patching Checks (Preparation Phase)
1.	Approval & Planning
o	Obtain necessary approvals from business and stakeholders.
o	Schedule patching during the maintenance window.
o	Check for compatibility of the patch with SQL Server version and applications.
2.	Backup & Recovery Readiness
o	Take full database backups (FULL, DIFF, T-LOG).
o	Backup master, msdb, model, and tempdb databases.
o	Backup SQL Server configuration (sp_configure settings, sys.dm_server_registry).
o	Backup SQL Agent Jobs, Linked Servers, and SSIS packages.
o	Snapshot/Backup OS and SQL Server binaries if VM-based.
3.	Check Current System Health
o	Verify database consistency (DBCC CHECKDB).
o	Run performance baseline reports (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
o	Capture running queries and active sessions (sp_who2, sys.dm_exec_requests).
o	Check SQL Server error logs and Windows Event logs for issues.
o	Validate AlwaysOn Availability Group, Replication, and Mirroring status.
o	Check disk space availability (xp_fixeddrives).
o	Validate SQL Server Agent and scheduled jobs.
4.	Disable Jobs & Features
o	Disable SQL Server Agent jobs and maintenance tasks.
o	Stop dependent applications and services.
o	Disable database replication, log shipping, or AlwaysOn if applicable.
o	Ensure no active database transactions are running.

Patching Process (Execution Phase)
1.	Apply the SQL Server Patch
o	Run SQL Server setup and choose the correct patch.
o	Follow on-screen instructions and monitor for errors.
o	Validate patch installation using SELECT @@VERSION.
2.	Monitor Upgrade Progress
o	Track patch installation via setup logs (C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\xxxx\Setup Bootstrap\Log).
o	Ensure no errors or warnings are encountered.

Post-Patching Checks (Validation Phase)
1.	Verify SQL Server Services
o	Ensure SQL Server services and SQL Server Agent are running.
o	Check SQL Server error logs for startup errors.
o	Validate cluster failover if in a cluster environment.
2.	Database Health & Performance
o	Run DBCC CHECKDB on critical databases.
o	Execute baseline performance checks (CPU, Memory, Disk).
o	Check replication, mirroring, log shipping, and AlwaysOn availability groups.
3.	Validate Applications & Connectivity
o	Test application connections to the database.
o	Run test queries to verify query execution performance.
o	Ensure Linked Servers, SSIS packages, and SQL Jobs are working fine.
4.	Re-Enable Jobs & Services
o	Enable SQL Agent jobs and verify execution.
o	Start any dependent applications or services.
5.	Final Backup & Documentation
o	Take a new full backup post-patching.
o	Document patching steps, issues, resolutions, and rollback plan if needed.
________________________________________
Rollback Plan (In Case of Failure)
1.	Restore the system/database backups.
2.	Revert to the previous SQL Server version (if needed).
3.	Validate rollback success with application teams.
